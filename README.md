## About Orbital Shapes

Orbital Shapes is an interactive simulation that lets you explore the fascinating world of gravity. Create your own celestial dance by placing shapes onto the canvas, each with its own gravitational pull. Watch as they interact, creating mesmerizing patterns and orbital paths. Experiment with different sizes, colors, and movement styles to discover unique and beautiful results.

## Getting Started

1. **Place Shapes:** Click anywhere on the black canvas to add a shape. Experiment with different sizes and positions. (Maximum 100 shapes)
2. **Shape Selection (Optional):** Choose from three different shapes by clicking on the icons in the bottom right corner.  If you don't select a shape, a circle will be the default shape.
3. **Adjust Parameters (Optional):** Use the "Size," "Gravity," and "Randomize Movement" sliders to adjust the properties of new shapes and the overall simulation environment.  Experiment to see how these settings affect the gravitational interactions. Shapes are placed with a random color, rotation, movement direction and speed.
4. **Start the Simulation:** Once you've placed some shapes and adjusted the parameters to your liking, click the "Play" button to begin the gravitational interactions.
5. **Observe and Explore:** Watch as the shapes interact, creating mesmerizing patterns and orbital paths.  Continue to experiment with different shapes and settings to discover new and interesting results.
6. **Control the Simulation:** Use the "Pause" button to stop the simulation and the "Reset" button to reset the canvas and and sliders.

## Controls

* **Play Button:** Starts the simulation.
* **Pause Button:** Pauses the simulation.
* **Reset Button:** Clears the canvas and resets all parameters.
* **Click:** Place a shape.
* **Shape Icons:** Select different shape types.
* **Size Slider:** Control the size and mass of new shapes.
* **Gravity Slider:** Adjust the overall gravitational force.
* **Randomize Movement Slider:** The default movement is linear. Use the "Randomize Movement" slider to create more erratic and unpredictable movement patterns.
