## About Orbital Shapes

Orbital Shapes is an interactive simulation that lets you explore the fascinating world of gravity.  Create your own celestial dance by placing shapes onto the canvas, each with its own gravitational pull. Watch as they interact, creating mesmerizing patterns and orbital paths. Experiment with different sizes, colors, and movement styles to discover unique and beautiful results.

## How to Play

1. **Placing Shapes:** Click anywhere on the black canvas to add a shape.
2. **Shape Selection:** Choose from three different shapes by clicking on the icons in the bottom right corner.
3. **Shape Size:** Adjust the size of the shapes using the "Size" slider. Larger shapes have greater mass and exert a stronger gravitational pull.
4. **Color and Movement:** Each shape is randomly assigned a color, rotation, movement direction, and speed.
5. **Global Gravity:** Control the overall gravitational force in the simulation using the "Gravity" slider. This affects all shapes equally.
6. **Movement Style:**  The default movement is linear.  Use the "Randomize Movement" slider to create more erratic and unpredictable movement patterns.

## Controls

* **Click:** Place a shape.
* **Shape Icons:** Select different shape types.
* **Size Slider:** Control the size and mass of new shapes.
* **Gravity Slider:** Adjust the overall gravitational force.
* **Randomize Movement Slider:**  Control the randomness of the shapes' movement.
